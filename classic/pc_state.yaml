  You grew up in the small village of Ingnam, a remote village with rich
  traditions, buried deep in the wilds. Every year for as long as you can
  remember, your village has chosen a champion to send to the cursed Demon
  Realm. Legend has it that in years Ingnam has failed to produce a champion,
  chaos has reigned over the countryside. Children disappear, crops wilt, and
  disease spreads like wildfire. This year, you have been selected to be the
  champion. What is your name?
