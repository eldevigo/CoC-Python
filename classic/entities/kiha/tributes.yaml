      'You jingle your gem pouch and ask if you could pay her to allow you
      passage.  Kiha shoulders her axe and scratches at one of her horns,
      mulling the idea over.  She stops and abruptly shakes her head.  "Not
      today.  Now scram, before I change my mind!"'

      'Kiha steps out from behind a tree with her axe on her back and her arms
      folded across her sizable chest.  "You again?  I''ve been thinking about
      what you said.  How about instead of beating you senseless, you pay me a
      tribute of 200 gems, and I''ll let you pass through my territory
      unhindered.  Of course, if you stumble into my lair I might have to teach
      you a lesson."  A greedy smile spreads across her dusky visage while her
      eyes burn with mischievous crimson light.  Wait a moment... wasn''t this
      your idea?'
