      'You ask why she''s trying to drive you off.  Confusion breaks out across
      Kiha''s brow for a moment before her visage hardens back into a confident
      sneer.  "I don''t need to explain myself to you.  I was strong enough to
      break out of Lethice''s base, and I''ve been strong enough to murder every
      lackey she''s sent after me."'

      'Thinking you may have found a way to win into the powerful warrior''s
      good graces, you start to explain that your whole purpose here is to
      defeat the demon queen.  She cuts you off by exhaling a whirling tornado
      of fire into the air.  The scorching inferno seems to suck the very breath
      from your lungs, robbing you of your words.  While the after-image still
      hangs in your vision, she declares, "I don''t give two licks about why
      you''re here.  I''m gonna beat your ass just for wasting my time!"'

      grimace.  This may have been a mistake.  She screams, "As if someone like
      you would have an idea worthy of being adopted by me!  I forgot about your
      insignificant offer as soon as I was away from you.  This tribute was
      devised solely with my own sizable wit and cunning!"'

      trade you is pain!"'
