      'An imposing figure drops out of the gnarled swamp trees, spraying loam
      and moss everywhere as it impacts the ground.  You immediately put up your
      {weapon} and take up a combat stance.  Laughing uproariously, the stranger
      straightens, tucking her rust-red wings behind her back.  She''s so busy
      with her mirth that you get a chance to get a good look at the six-foot
      tall monster of a woman.  Though her face has human-like features, a pair
      of wicked horns protrude from her forehead, giving evidence to more than a
      little taint.  The twin spikes match the curve of her skull, the pointed
      tips sticking out a ways behind her.  Her eyes are nearly solid crimson
      with inky black slits in the middle.  Dark red scales run up her arms and
      legs to meet on her back.  A powerful reptilian tail hangs down behind
      her, whipping back and forth with dangerous strength.'

      '"Eyes up here, {gender_slur}" commands the draconic woman - and she''s
      definitely a woman; the dark-skinned entrance between her muscled legs is
      evidence enough of that.  She twirls a wicked-looking double-headed axe as
      she warns, "You seem to have stumbled across my territory.  Let me make
      this clear to you: I own this stretch of swamp, and if you step foot in
      this area again, I''m going to beat you until you wish you ran into
      Lethice herself. Now run along, before you dread the day you met Kiha!"  A
      thin trail of heat shimmers in the air with each pass of her axe''s
      blades, left behind by the obviously magical implement.'

      '"Don''t even start," she commands, advancing on you as she continues, "I
      told you to avoid my domain and yet you ignored my imperative and
      returned.  You may be a fucking masochist or a retard, but trust me, you
      won''t enjoy this."'
